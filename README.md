# Reverb Example Code

This is some example code to accompany _Let's Write A Reverb_, presented at ADC 2021.

The interesting stuff is in `reverb-example-code.h`, the other stuff is just plumbing.

It depends on my [DSP helper library](https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/code/dsp/) for the delay objects, and this should be cloned as `dsp/`.  It should be easy enough to adapt to another framework.
